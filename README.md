# About Project Euler

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of fun and challenging computer programming problems that require the use of a combination of math & logic to solve. Think of them as interesting coding puzzles that will exercise your brain and coding muscles at the same time. 

With some basic knowledge of Ruby, you should already know enough programming to express solutions to these test-driven labs. There may be cases where you need to look up new techniques, brush up on mathematical concepts or look up an algorithm for help. Google is your friend!

From the [website](link:"https://projecteuler.net/): "Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."

## Project Euler on Learn

We have started moving some Project Euler challenges over to Learn so that Learners around the world can upgrade their Ruby skills, have some fun and Learn together. We also think solving these challenges in a test-driven way on Learn, and having your solution automatically pushed to GitHub, is a great way to track your progress and share it with the world. You can of course also ask questions of the Learn community to get help when you're stuck. 

We hope to port more Project Euler labs over to Learn over time.

## Who is behind Project Euler?

Project Euler was started by Colin Hughes in October 2001 on mathschallenge.net. It was later moved to its own domain, [https://projecteuler.net/](link:https://projecteuler.net/) where hundreds of problems are now hosted. 

## Hints for solving these problems

- Read the problem statement carefully. 
- Note and understand the example cases provided. 
- Feel free to experiment with pencil & paper to get a feel for the problem. 
- If the mathematical material is new to you, some quick Internet research should provide plenty of reference material. 
- Try using IRB to write simple programs to test simple cases and confirm that you've grasped the example cases.
